Assets
======

Basic Asset Management system 

Your stock standard lists of assets with depreciation

Supports barcode powered stocktake including barcode location sticker.  i.e. code all your locations, scan that code first and Assets will record that asset at that location. Once done, reports will show what is there, what isn't there and what is there that previously was somewhere else.

Its a bit raw at the moment but if anyone is interested, I'll put the effort in a polish it up.
